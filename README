What is Oson?
Fast, compatible, secure, html5 building block set.
This not a toolkit like jquery. It's a incomplete collection of routines. 
Not easy. Just professional. Not a big deal.


!!!!!If you are not a good javascript programmer is not right for you!!!!!!


Why? Story.

2 years ago I started a HTML5 project. The goal was a simple interactive user 
interface. Which can not wait for the server response. He treats the background. 
Like gmail. It's not too complicated. I started to walk in the normal way. 
Following the advice. First of jquery. Then I collected the javascripts. 2 months 
later i had 24 javascripttoolkit. This was not a problem. But the upgrade of the 
system. A real surprise. I saw my project went into chaos.
The genius dominates the chaos. But I'm an idiot. 
So I wrote a custom system. 7 main function, and a few sub function. 
(Plus an Internet Explorer Compatibility Toolkit.) (The server side OSON systems 
(OSONphp, OSONADAaws, OSONpython)not part of OSON. )
I did not want to change the javascript language. (like jquery) I just want a few extra 
functions.
So you ask why OSON? 
Because with OSON you can work faster.
